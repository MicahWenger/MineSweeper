# Minesweeper
A clone of minesweeper, with an in progress solving algorithm

Uses Javascript

## To Use:
  - Open index.html with your browser.
  - Level dificulty can be selected below the board
  - Flag with right click, reveal with left click
  - Red "Solve" button solves as much as the algorithm can, you can still reveal and flag to play if the algorithm has not enitrely solved it
  - Reset by clicking the face in the top center of the screen
  
  
  ## Solving Algorithm:
  - Currently only uses a few rules to reveal and flag 100% confident answers
  - Uses HTML images to get data, because what fun would it be to just pull data from the solution array
  - I added a delay to watch the solving happen, but it could pretty much be instantanious if you take it out
